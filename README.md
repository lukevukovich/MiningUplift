# Mining _Uplift_

Mining Uplift is a mining-focused mod for Minecraft 1.15.2 that expands the underground experience with new ores, armor, tools, and an entirely new dimension.

## To do
- Calibrate mob spawning in cave dimension
    - Review gemstone lighting (ore generation)
    - Attempt to ignore light levels when spawning mobs?
    - A **_lot_** of stoneman
- Replicate cave dimension teleportation crash
    - Low health
    - Used teleporter a few times
    - Overworld -> Cave Dimension
- Fix portal linking
    - Linking seems to be one step behind
    - Creating new portal in cave dimension should link correctly to the overworld
        - it _does_ but the linking is one step behind
- Fix fire block border rendering
- Handle `/clear` command with armor/item effects
